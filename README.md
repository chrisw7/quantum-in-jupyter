# quantum-in-jupyter
Review of basic quantum mechanics using an interactive Jupyter notebook. Covers:

- [x] Modelling (using finite-difference methods) and visualization of the eigenfunctions and wavefunctions of a quantum harmonic oscillator.
- [ ] Visualization of a gaussian wavepacket in a resonant tunneling diode (demonstration of quantum tunneling & reflection

Based off of a projects I completed for the NE 232 course at the University of Waterloo (see .pdf/.tex)
